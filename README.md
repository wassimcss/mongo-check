In this checkpoint, the main idea is to manipulate mongodb CRUD operations

Create a database called "contact"
Create a collection called "contactlist"
Insert these documents  in "contactlist" :
Last name: Ben Lahmer, First name: Fares, Email: fares@gmail.com, age:26
Last name: Kefi, First name: Seif, Email: kefi@gmail.com, age:15
Last name: Fatnassi, First name: Sarra, Email: sarra.f@gmail.com, age:40
Last name: Ben Yahia, First name: Rym, age:4
Last name: Cherif, First name: Sami, age:3

Display all the contact list
Display all the information about only one person using his id
Display all the contact list having age>18
Display all the contact list having age>18 and name containing "ah"
Change the contact first name of "kefi Seif" by "Kefi Anis"
Delete the the contact list having age < 5
Display all the contact list
NB:You have to save your work as screenshots
